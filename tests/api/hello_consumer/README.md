## I am an addon consumer, apparently.

I'm not even sure what an addon or a CMake is. I know I have CMake, NodeJS, and a C++ compiler installed on this system (and this Ninja thing?), but honestly, I have never once had to touch any of that stuff.

I just import addons from my neighbours and they all seem to "just work" for me. I am a happy consumer! :)

Usually, I import these addons from online package repositories in ZIP or TAR format and they all work perfectly. The only reason I am not doing that today is ,because of something about a ```CMakeJS.cmake``` script not being on the 'master' branch yet! so I have to fetch the addon from next door until then, but I'm told that everything will work exactly the same for me, when that does happen.

Something seems to be getting built in my node_modules dir whenever I ```npm/yarn install```....

Please see my package.json to understand how I work.
