## I am an addon with cURL API support.

You can build me, export me as a Javscript module, and share your comments with importing consumers' users' intellisense engines; write descriptions of the cool functions and features that you build, so that your users will have an even better experience using your addon.

Please see my package.json to understand how to make HTTP POST requests with me.

More cURL API examples can be found at [https://curl.se/libcurl/c/example.html](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/example.html).
